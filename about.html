            With Bharat Parivartan, we will strive to create:
            <ol>
              <li>
                An operating strategy that includes internal organizational structure and external partnerships that are crucial for creating the organization’s intended impact; and,
              </li>
              <li>
                A resource strategy that defines where and on what terms the organization will acquire the resources (financial and human) it needs to do its work.
              </li>
            </ol>
            We are committed to provide a channel that would enable a social entrepreneur to convert inputs into outcomes and the generation of both social value (measurable impact) and economic value (revenue).

          <p class="deep-orange-text text-darken-4"><strong>Entrepreneur</strong></p>
          <p>Just as entrepreneurs change the face of business, Social entrepreneurs act as the change agents for the society, seizing opportunities (that most others miss) to improve systems, inventing new approaches, and creating solutions to change the society for the better. The eco-system is becoming conducive in India to venture into entrepreneurship. To create a better society and harness the growth opportunities, the pressing social problems need to be addressed to reduce the gap with between the haves and the have-nots.</p>
          <p>At BP, we believe that entrepreneurs through Social enterprises hold the potential to make India’s growing economy an inclusive growth and an opportunity to work in key areas to improve the eco system for the under-privilege citizens. By employing innovative business models, social enterprises are and will address India’s vast development needs in a sustainable manner using viable revenue models. It is our endeavor to identify such entrepreneurs and work with them to create sustainable solutions for social problems.</p>
          <p>Given the magnitude and the complexities of social problems in India, achieving greatest possible impact from limited available resources in critical. At Bharat Parivartan, we understand that this can only be achieved through careful investment decisions and diligent impact assessment. Bharat Parivartan will reach out to students, entrepreneurs and corporate executives drawing talent and proposals. If you have ideas, commitment to change and tackle issues, persistent with innovative solutions to solve major social issues, we would like to hear about them.</p>

          <p class="deep-orange-text text-darken-4"><strong>Social Entrepreneurship</strong></p>
          <p>About applying practical, innovative and sustainable approaches to benefit society in general, with an emphasis on those who are marginalized and poor.</p>
          <p>A term that captures a unique approach to economic and social problems, an approach that cuts across sectors and disciplines grounded in certain values and processes that are common to each social entrepreneur, independent of whether his/ her area of focus has been education, health, welfare reform, human rights, workers' rights, environment, economic development, agriculture, etc., or whether the organizations they set up are non-profit or for-profit entities.</p>
          <p>It is this approach that sets the social entrepreneur apart from the rest of the crowd of well-meaning people and organizations who dedicate their lives to social improvement.</p>
          <p class="deep-orange-text text-darken-4"><strong>Social Business Ventures</strong></p>
          <p>The entrepreneur sets up a for-profit entity or business to provide a social or ecological product or service. While profits are ideally generated, the main aim is not to maximize financial returns for shareholders but to grow the social venture and reach more people in need. Wealth accumulation is not a priority and profits are reinvested in the enterprise to fund expansion. The entrepreneur of a social business venture seeks investors who are interested in combining financial and social returns on their investments.</p>
